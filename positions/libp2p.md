# Network Engineer, Lodestar/LibP2P (TypeScript)

{% include intro.html %}

### About Lodestar/LibP2P

Libp2p is a peer-to-peer networking protocol enabling Lodestar to participate
in Ethereum consensus through its TypeScript implementation.
Lodestar is an Ethereum consensus-layer client _(Eth 2.0)_ and ecosystem of
resources to provide and support the next generation of light clients. Light
clients are the missing piece in today's blockchain ecosystems to achieve
decentralization across the entire stack. You will contribute to ensuring the
long-term success of Ethereum while being at the edge of multiple technological
fronts.

### Who we need

As a network engineer, you will contribute to Lodestar and Libp2p by
developing accurate, secure and performant code to implement various networking
specifications. No prior blockchain experience is required, but it is expected
to gain protocol proficiency over time. You'll also have the opportunity to
engage with a wider Ethereum/Libp2p protocol community, other client teams, and
public goods maintainers and contribute to research efforts to influence its
future design. The position is full-time and remote-friendly.

### Responsibilities

- Understand a protocol specification and develop a highly performant
  implementation
- Research multiple solutions and evaluate their performance trade-offs
- Implement and maintain new networking specifications such as light-client
  p2p solutions
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client and our open-source
  networking libraries (e.g., `js-libp2p-gossipsub`, `js-libp2p-yamux`, or
  `js-libp2p-noise`)
- Review, audit and test your teammates' code
- Provide feedback on overall design decisions
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge and
  improve the protocol networking stack

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in TypeScrit
  - 5+ years of TypeScrit programming language, paradigms, constructs, and idioms
  - 7+ years of professional software back-end development experience (no front-end experience required)
- Experience developing highly performant, secure, and scalable networking software
- Effective usage of TypeScript debugging tools
- Be able to proactively dive into the novel territory and share knowledge on
  what you've learned
- Basic understanding of cryptography and common applications
- Ability to write clean and effective documentation and comments\
- Experience in distributed applications and peer-to-peer networking
- Comfortable learning complex protocols from scratch
- Takes initiative, is a self-starter, is accountable for work
- Experience with open-source software _or_ strong communication skills as we
  actively coordinate with external parties

### Nice to have

- Experience with other networking stacks, including but not limited to tcp/ip, udp, quic
- Experience with blockchain protocols, whether it be the usage of a blockchain
  API, knowledge of how a blockchain operates, or any other experience
- Experience with distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, network
  programming, or cryptography
- Experience writing software from a technical specification or a reference
  implementation
- Experience maintaining a large codebase with many components and keeping it
  well-designed, future-proofed, and modular
- Experience with documenting a large codebase, both for internal and
  user-facing components
- Familiarity with open-source software principles
- Familiar with Git and GitHub/GitLab
- Can construct and maintain CI/CD pipelines
- Experience with RPC, WebSockets, or GraphQL
- Performance analysis and optimization, optimizing data structures and
  algorithms
