  p2p solutions
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client and our open-source
  networking libraries (e.g., `js-libp2p-gossipsub`, `js-libp2p-yamux`, or
  `js-libp2p-noise`)
- Review, audit and test your teammates' code
- Provide feedback on overall design decisions
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge and
  improve the protocol networking stack

### Required skills and experience

- Experience developing highly performant, secure, and scalable networking
  software
- Senior Proficiency in JavaScript and TypeScript (no front-end experience
