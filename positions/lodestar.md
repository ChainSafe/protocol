long-term success of Ethereum while being at the edge of multiple technological
fronts.

### Who we need

As a protocol engineer, you will contribute to Lodestar by developing accurate,
secure and performant code to implement various specifications. No prior
blockchain experience is required, but it is expected for you gain protocol
proficiency over time. You'll also have the opportunity to engage with the wider
Ethereum consensus community, and other client teams and contribute to research
efforts to influence its future design. The position is full-time and
remote-friendly.

### Responsibilities

- Understand a protocol specification and develop a highly performant
  implementation
- Research multiple solutions and evaluate their performance-memory trade-offs
- Research and develop novel light-client solutions
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client and supporting libraries
- Review, audit and test your teammates' code
- Provide feedback on overall design decisions
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge and
  improve each other's clients

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in TypeScrit
  - 3+ years of TypeScrit programming language, paradigms, constructs, and idioms
