# Protocol Engineer, Gossamer/Polkadot (Go)

{% include intro.html %}

### About Gossamer/Polkadot

As a protocol engineer for Gossamer, you will join a small team and develop and
maintain the Go implementation of the Polkadot blockchain protocol, often
referred to as a _host_ or a _client_. You will be tasked with
implementing new features, occasionally from a technical specification or a
reference implementation; maintaining existing features; ensuring the
implementation stays compatible with the current and historical specifications
of the protocol, and updating the code when upgrades are made to the network.

### Who we need

As a protocol engineer, you have the desire to implement and deploy novel
protocols that have never been implemented before in that language, you have a
passion for open-source software and understanding that you will be maintaining
code that will be widely used on a decentralized network, you are able to
clearly communicate and document your thoughts, and you have the desire to
contribute to the space. The position is full-time and remote-friendly.

### Responsibilities

- Read and understand a protocol specification and be able to break it into
  issues and turn it into Go code
- Design and implement new features for the Polkadot host
- Refactor and improve existing features in the Polkadot host
- Ensure the client stays compatible with the other host implementations
- Maintain up-to-date technical documentation
- Collaborate with and assist team members with their issues
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge on the
  protocol, whether it be high-level protocol details or technical details that
  are common to every client
- Communicate effectively with the team and document your code and the client
  as a whole

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in Go
  - 5+ years of Go programming language, paradigms, constructs, and idioms
  - 8+ years of professional software back-end development experience
- Knowledge of system design in Go
- Effective usage of Go debugging tools
- Familiarity with Rust and high conviction to learn
- Understanding of distributed systems, consensus algorithms, networking models,
  and broadcast algorithms
- 3+ years of experience working with blockchain or highly distributed systems
- Be able to proactively dive into the novel territory and share knowledge on
  what you've learned
- Basic understanding of cryptography and common applications
- Ability to write clean and effective documentation and comments
- Experience working with open-source software projects
    - Familiarity with open-source software principles

### Nice to have

- Experience with Rust, as the Polkadot reference implementation (Substrate) is
  written in Rust
- Experience with blockchain protocols, whether it be the usage of a blockchain
  API, knowledge of how a blockchain operates, or any other experience
- Experience with distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, network
  programming, or cryptography
- Experience writing software from a technical specification or a reference
  implementation
- Experience maintaining a large codebase with many components and keeping it
  well-designed, future-proofed, and modular
- Experience with documenting a large codebase, both for internal and
  user-facing components
- Experience with RPC, WebSockets, or GraphQL
