##### About Forest

As a protocol engineer for Forest, you will join a small team and develop and
maintain the Rust implementation of the Filecoin blockchain protocol, often
referred to as a _node_ or a blockchain _client_. You will be tasked with
implementing new features, occasionally from a technical specification or a
reference implementation; maintaining existing features; ensuring the
implementation stays compatible with the current specification of the protocol,
and updating the code when upgrades are made to the network. The position is
full-time and remote-friendly.

##### About the role

As a protocol engineer, you have the desire to implement and deploy novel
protocols that have never been implemented before in that language, you have a
passion for open-source software and understanding that you will be maintaining
code that will be widely used on a decentralized network, you are able to
clearly communicate and document your thoughts, and you have the desire to
contribute to the space.

### Responsibilities

- Read and understand a protocol specification and be able to break it into
  issues and turn it into Rust code
- Design and implement new features for the client
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client
- Ensure the client says compatible with the other client implementations
- Collaborate with and assist team members with their issues
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge on the
  protocol, whether it be high-level protocol details or technical details that
  are common to every client
- Communicate effectively with the team and document your code and the client
  as a whole

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in Rust
- Knowledge of system design in Rust
- Be able to proactively dive into the novel territory and share knowledge on
  what you've learned

### Nice to have

  API, knowledge of how a blockchain operates, or any other experience
- Experience with distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, network
  programming, and cryptography
- Experience writing software from a technical specification or a reference
  implementation
- Experience maintaining a large codebase with many components and keeping it
  well-designed, future-proofed, and modular
- Experience with documenting a large codebase, both for internal and
  user-facing components
- Familiarity with open-source software principles
