# Protocol Engineer, Forest/Filecoin (Rust)

{% include intro.html %}

### Here's what you need to know before reading on

- Our progressive tech stack includes Go, Rust, and TypeScript
- We spearhead ecosystem projects like
  [Lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar),
  [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest), and
  [Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer)
- We are global, remote-friendly, and open to contractors

At ChainSafe, you'll be part of a team that believes in the community's vital
importance and contributes to advancing humanity with open-source and
decentralized technology.

##### About Forest

As a protocol engineer for Forest, you will join a small team and develop and
maintain the Rust implementation of the Filecoin blockchain protocol, often
referred to as a _node_ or a blockchain _client_. You will be tasked with
implementing new features, occasionally from a technical specification or a
reference implementation; maintaining existing features; ensuring the
implementation stays compatible with the current and historical specifications
of the protocol, and updating the code when upgrades are made to the network.

##### About the role

As a protocol engineer, you have the desire to implement and deploy novel
protocols that have never been implemented before in that language, you have a
passion for open-source software and understanding that you will be maintaining
code that will be widely used on a decentralized network, you are able to
clearly communicate and document your thoughts, and you have the desire to
contribute to the space. The position is full-time and remote-friendly.

### Responsibilities

- Read and understand a protocol specification and be able to break it into
  issues and turn it into Rust code
- Design and implement new features for the client
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client
- Ensure the client stays compatible with the other client implementations
- Collaborate with and assist team members with their issues
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge on the
  protocol, whether it be high-level protocol details or technical details that
  are common to every client
- Communicate effectively with the team and document your code and the client
  as a whole

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in Rust
- Knowledge of system design in Rust
- Be able to proactively dive into the novel territory and share knowledge on
  what you've learned

### Nice to have

- Experience with Go, as the Filecoin reference implementation (Lotus) is
  written in Go
- Experience with blockchain protocols, whether it be the usage of a blockchain
  API, knowledge of how a blockchain operates, or any other experience
- Experience with distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, network
  programming, or cryptography
- Experience writing software from a technical specification or a reference
  implementation
- Experience maintaining a large codebase with many components and keeping it
  well-designed, future-proofed, and modular
- Experience with documenting a large codebase, both for internal and
  user-facing components
- Familiarity with open-source software principles
