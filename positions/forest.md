# Protocol Engineer, Forest/Filecoin (Rust)

{% include intro.html %}

### About Forest/Filecoin

As a protocol engineer for Forest, you will join a small team and develop and
maintain the Rust implementation of the Filecoin blockchain protocol, often
referred to as a _node_ or a blockchain _client_. You will be tasked with
implementing new features, occasionally from a technical specification or a
reference implementation; maintaining existing features; ensuring the
implementation stays compatible with the current and historical specifications
of the protocol, and updating the code when upgrades are made to the network.

### Who we need

As a protocol engineer, you have the desire to implement and deploy novel
protocols that have never been implemented before in that language, you have a
passion for open-source software and understanding that you will be maintaining
code that will be widely used on a decentralized network, you are able to
clearly communicate and document your thoughts, and you have the desire to
contribute to the space. The position is full-time and remote-friendly.

### Responsibilities

- Read and understand a protocol specification and be able to break it into
  issues and turn it into Rust code
- Design and implement new features for the client
- Refactor and improve existing features in the client
- Ensure the client stays compatible with the other client implementations
- Collaborate with and assist team members with their issues
- Collaborate with other protocol implementation teams to share knowledge on the
  protocol, whether it be high-level protocol details or technical details that
  are common to every client
- Communicate effectively with the team and document your code and the client
  as a whole

### Required skills and experience

- Proficiency in Rust
  - 3+ years of Rust programming language, paradigms, constructs, and idioms
  - 5+ years of professional software back-end development experience
- Knowledge of system design in Rust
- Effective usage of Rust debugging tools
- Be able to proactively dive into the novel territory and share knowledge on
  what you've learned
- Basic understanding of cryptography and common applications
- Ability to write clean and effective documentation and comments

### Nice to have

- Experience with Go, as the Filecoin reference implementation (Lotus) is
  written in Go
- Experience with blockchain protocols, whether it be the usage of a blockchain
  API, knowledge of how a blockchain operates, or any other experience
- Experience with distributed systems, peer-to-peer systems, network
  programming, or cryptography
- Experience writing software from a technical specification or a reference
  implementation
- Experience maintaining a large codebase with many components and keeping it
  well-designed, future-proofed, and modular
- Experience with documenting a large codebase, both for internal and
  user-facing components
- Familiarity with open-source software principles
- Familiar with Git and GitHub/GitLab
- Can construct and maintain CI/CD pipelines
- Experience with RPC, WebSockets, or GraphQL
- Performance analysis and optimization, optimizing data structures and
  algorithms
