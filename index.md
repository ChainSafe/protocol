# ChainSafe Systems Protocol Engineering

The Protocol-Engineering Department at ChainSafe Systems hosts all teams
that implement specifications of decentralized ledger technologies as well as
communication protocols. In general, protocols are clearly specified sets of
rules and regulations that determine how data is transmitted and processed,
as well as define the interfaces to access and manipulate even those.

Currently, we are active in the Ethereum, Filecoin, and Polkadot ecosystems.
The following libraries we maintain are the cornerstones of ChainSafe Protocol:
* [Lodestar](https://lodestar.chainsafe.io): A modular Ethereum
  consensus-layer client (TypeScript)
* [Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest): A full-node client
  implementation for Filecoin (Rust)
* [Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer): A Polkadot host (Go)

Open positions:
* [Protocol Engineer, Lodestar/Ethereum (TypeScript)](./positions/lodestar.html)
* [Protocol Networking Engineer, Lodestar/LibP2P (TypeScript)](./positions/libp2p.html)
* [Protocol Engineer, Forest/Filecoin (Rust)](./positions/forest.html)
* [Protocol Engineer, Gossamer/Polkadot (Go)](./positions/gossamer.html)

To apply, send a short introduction and a résumé to <afri@chainsafe.io>. The
doors for protocol engineering opportunities remain always open despite market
conditions.
