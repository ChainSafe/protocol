# ChainSafe Systems Protocol Engineering

Protocol engineering is a field that involves the design, implementation, and
analysis of protocols for communication systems. Protocols are sets of rules
and standards that govern the exchange of information between devices or
systems. Protocol engineering is an interdisciplinary field that involves
expertise in computer science, electrical engineering, and network theory.

ChainSafe's protocol engineering department is responsible for designing and
implementing protocols for blockchain systems. This may involve developing
protocols for consensus mechanisms, data storage and retrieval, security, and
other aspects of blockchain technology. The engineers in this department are
also responsible for analyzing and testing protocols to ensure that they are
reliable and secure.

In addition to designing and implementing protocols, protocol engineers are also
responsible for researching and staying up-to-date on the latest developments in
blockchain technology. They may work closely with other engineers, researchers,
and developers to design and implement new protocols and integrate blockchain
technology into existing systems. Blockchain protocol engineering is a rapidly
evolving field that plays a critical role in developing and adopting blockchain
technology.

### Protocols at ChainSafe

Currently, we are active in the Ethereum, Filecoin, and Polkadot ecosystems.
The following libraries we maintain are the cornerstones of **ChainSafe
Protocol**.

* **[Lodestar](https://lodestar.chainsafe.io) - an Ethereum consensus-layer
  client (TypeScript):** Lodestar is a software that implements the Ethereum
  consensus protocol and enables users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
  The Ethereum consensus protocol is a set of rules that govern how transactions
  are processed and validated on the Ethereum network.
* **[Forest](https://github.com/ChainSafe/forest) - a full-node client for
  Filecoin (Rust):** A full-node client implementation for Filecoin is
  responsible for implementing the Filecoin protocol, which includes the
  consensus mechanism, data storage and retrieval, and other aspects of the
  Filecoin network. It allows users to connect to the Filecoin network, download
  and validate the blockchain, and participate in the consensus process.
* **[Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer) - a Polkadot host (Go):**
  A Polkadot host is a peer-to-peer client that runs a full-node implementation
  of the Polkadot protocol and participates in the Polkadot network as a
  validator. As a validator, a Polkadot host is responsible for verifying and
  validating transactions on the Polkadot network. It does this by participating
  in the consensus process, which involves reaching an agreement with other
  validators on the state of the network.

In addition to the protocol clients, we design, implement, and maintain a list
of cryptographic, serialization, and networking libraries.

* [bls](https://github.com/ChainSafe/bls): A JavaScript implementation of
  Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Signatures (BLS).
* [discv5](https://github.com/ChainSafe/discv5): A TypeScript implementation of
  the Ethereum Discovery V5 protocol (`discv5`).
* [go-schnorrkel](https://github.com/ChainSafe/go-schnorrkel): Schnorr
  Signatures over Ristretto255 in pure Go.
* [js-libp2p-gossipsub](https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-gossipsub):
  A TypeScript implementation of Gossipsub.
* [js-libp2p-noise](https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise): A Noise
  libp2p handshake for js-libp2p.
* [ssz](https://github.com/ChainSafe/ssz): A TypeScript implementation of
  Simple Serialize (SSZ).
